# LinuxDeletionUtility
A simple utility for deleting unnecessary files in a user's Home folder.

**Build Environment:** Linux Mint 17.2 Cinnamon amd64, MonoDevelop 5.9.5

**Notes:**
- This implementation will lack *secure* deletion, this will be added during the next phase of the project.

**To do:**
- Give the application an original name.
- Implement native (C#) file handling and bring in a secure deletion library.
- Implement Unit Testing.
- Add deletion options for Applications and Desktops and include sub-items so the user can better select what to delete and what to leave.
- Include a configuration file so a user can keep their selection saved.
- Clone repository to Virtual Machine for safer development and testing.

**Change Log:**
- **11/08/2015**: Began the project with the aim of creating a user-friendly application which can help keep a user's Home folder tidy and clean.
- **12/08/2015**: Included some basic deletion functionality and organised the code into sections, or what I call 'blocks'.
